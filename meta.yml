  Mathematical Components Library on real closed fields
description: |-
  This library contains definitions and theorems about real closed
  fields, with a construction of the real closure and the algebraic
  closure (including a proof of the fundamental theorem of
  algebra). It also contains a proof of decidability of the first
  order theory of real closed field, through quantifier elimination.

  ## Documentation
  The repository contains
  - the decision procedure `rcf_sat` and its corectness lemma [`rcf_satP`](https://github.com/math-comp/real-closed/blob/3721886fffb13ea9c80824043f119ffed0c780f2/theories/qe_rcf.v#L991) for the first order theory of real closed fields through
  [certified quantifier elimination](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00593738v4)
  - the definition `{realclosure F}` , a [construction of the real closure of an archimedean field](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00671809v2), which is canonically a [`rcfType`](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/c1ec9cd8e7e50f73159613c492aad4c6c40bc3aa/mathcomp/algebra/ssrnum.v#L63) when `F` is an archimedean field, and the characteristic theorems of section [`RealClosureTheory`](https://github.com/math-comp/real-closed/blob/3721886fffb13ea9c80824043f119ffed0c780f2/theories/realalg.v#L1477).
  - the definition `complex R`,  a construction of the algebraic closure of a real closed field, which is canonically a [`numClosedFieldType`](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/c1ec9cd8e7e50f73159613c492aad4c6c40bc3aa/mathcomp/algebra/ssrnum.v#L73) that additionally satisfies [`complexalg_algebraic`](https://github.com/math-comp/real-closed/blob/3721886fffb13ea9c80824043f119ffed0c780f2/theories/complex.v#L1324).

  Except for the end-results listed above, one should not rely on anything.

  The formalization is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp)
  library for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant.


  ## Development instructions

  ### With nix.

  1. Install nix:
    - To install it on a single-user unix system where you have admin
      rights, just type:

      > sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)

      You should run this under your usual user account, not as
      root. The script will invoke `sudo` as needed.

      For other configurations (in particular if multiple users share
      the machine) or for nix uninstallation, go to the [appropriate
      section of the nix
      manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-installing-binary).

    - You need to **log out of your desktop session and log in again** before you proceed to step 2.

    - Step 1. only need to be done once on a same machine.

  2. Open a new terminal. Navigate to the root of the Abel repository. Then type:
     > nix-shell

     - This will download and build the required packages, wait until
       you get a shell.
     - You need to type this command every time you open a new terminal.
     - You can call `nixEnv` after you start the nix shell to see your
       work environemnet (or call `nix-shell` with option `--arg
       print-env true`).

  3. You are now in the correct work environment. You can do
     > make

     and do whatever you are accustomed to do with Coq.

  4. In particular, you can edit files using `emacs` or `coqide`.

     - If you were already using emacs with proof general, make sure you
       empty your `coq-prog-name` variables and any other proof general
       options that used to be tied to a previous local installation of
       Coq.
     - If you do not have emacs installed, but want to use it, you can
       go back to step 2. and call `nix-shell` with the following option
       > nix-shell --arg withEmacs true

       in order to get a temporary installation of emacs and
       proof-general.  Make sure you add `(require 'proof-site)` to your
       `$HOME/.emacs`.
